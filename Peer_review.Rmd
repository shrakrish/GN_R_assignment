1. The first half of the code ran pretty smoothly.
However for this part, 

```{r}
Tteosinte = as.data.frame(t(teosinte))
Tmaize = as.data.frame(t(maize))
```

```{r}
write_csv(Tteosinte, "TeoNoHeaders", col_names = FALSE)
write_csv(Tmaize, "MaizeNoHeaders", col_names = FALSE)
```

```{r}
Tteosinte2 = read_csv("TeoNoHeaders", col_names = TRUE)
Tmaize2 = read_csv("MaizeNoHeaders", col_names = TRUE)
Sample_ID = snp %>%
  select(1)
LabeledTeo = cbind(Sample_ID, Tteosinte2)
LabeledMaize = cbind(Sample_ID, Tmaize2)
```

2.I think that once you transpose the maize and teosinte files, you should automatically have column 1 that matches the SNP file. The only issue would be that it would have no heading. you can add a heading and make sure it's common with the snp file and merge it later. That would be simpler, however what ypu've used works as well so no problems there!

3. When it came to this part, I had problems running it and I'm not quite sure why
```{r}
setwd("./teosinte/Ascending")
#I want to store the files in this specific folder hence why I had to change to working directory
i = 1
while(i <= 10){
  a = i
  ChromTeosinteAscending = filter(MergedTeo, MergedTeo$Chromosome == a)
  ChromTeosinteAscending$Position = as.numeric(as.character(ChromTeosinteAscending$Position))
  ChromTeosinteAscending = ChromTeosinteAscending[order(ChromTeosinteAscending$Position), ]
  write_csv(ChromTeosinteAscending, sprintf("Ascending_TeoChromosome_%s", a), col_names = TRUE)
  i = i + 1
}
```

4.This is the error it kept showing me : Show in New WindowClear OutputExpand/Collapse Output

5. The visualisation part of your code was perfect! The graphs look great!
